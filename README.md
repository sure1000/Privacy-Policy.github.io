Privacy Policy for Our Android Applications

Last updated: July 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Rajpoot Integrated Services ("I," "me," or "our") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of our Android applications (the "Service" or "Apps"). This privacy policy applies to all applications offered by Rajpoot Integrated Services.
By using our Apps, you signify your acceptance of this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Apps. Your continued use of the Apps following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.

Information We Collect

Our Apps are designed with your privacy in mind. We collect information primarily to provide and improve the Service, and to ensure its stability and functionality.

Information You Provide Voluntarily

We do not typically require you to provide personally identifiable information directly to use the core features of our Apps. If any app feature does require such information (e.g., for user accounts or specific services you opt into), it will be clearly indicated at the point of collection, and your explicit consent will be sought.

Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data & Device Information)

When you use our Apps, We and our third-party service providers may automatically collect certain information, including:

•	Log Data & Crash Reports: In case of an error or crash within an App, we collect data and information (through third-party products like Firebase Crashlytics) on your device called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the App when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, error stack traces, and other statistics. This helps me diagnose and fix issues to improve app stability.

•	Analytics Data: We use Google Analytics for Firebase to understand how our Apps are used. This service collects data such as how often users open the app, what features they use, session duration, device model, operating system version, general geographic location (e.g., country), and other aggregated usage patterns. This data is anonymized or pseudonymized where possible and helps me improve the user experience.

•	Advertising ID: If you have consented to personalized advertising, our Apps may use your device's Advertising ID (e.g., Google Advertising ID on Android). This identifier is used by advertising networks (like AdMob) to serve ads that may be more relevant to you. You can reset your Advertising ID or opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings.

How we use Collected Information

Rajpoot Integrated Services may collect and use Users' information for the following purposes:

•	To provide and improve our Service: Information like crash reports and analytics helps me understand issues, fix bugs, and enhance features and usability.

•	To personalize user experience (with consent): If you consent to personalized ads, your Advertising ID may be used to show you more relevant advertisements.

•	To serve advertisements (with consent): Our Apps may display advertisements via Google AdMob to support the free availability of our services. Your consent for ad-related data processing is managed as described in the "User Consent and Control" section.

•	To ensure app stability and security: Log data helps me monitor app performance and identify potential security issues.

Third-Party Service Providers

Our Apps utilize third-party services that may collect information used to identify you or enhance app functionality. We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties may have access to certain information. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose than to provide services to me.

•	Google Play Services

•	AdMob (Google)

•	Google Analytics for Firebase

•	Firebase Crashlytics

Please review their privacy policies to understand their data practices.

User Consent and Control (Google Consent Mode V2)

We respect your privacy choices and are committed to complying with data protection regulations, including the EU User Consent Policy. Our Apps implement Google's Consent Mode V2 to manage how Google services (like Google Analytics for Firebase and AdMob) behave based on your consent status.

When you first launch our Apps, or as required by law (particularly if you are in the European Economic Area - EEA, or the UK), you will be presented with a consent banner. This banner allows you to make choices regarding:

•	Analytics Storage (analytics_storage): Consent for storing and accessing information for analytics purposes (e.g., usage statistics).

•	Ad Storage (ad_storage): Consent for storing and accessing information related to advertising (e.g., cookies or device identifiers for ads).

•	Ad User Data (ad_user_data): Consent for sending user data to Google for online advertising purposes.

•	Ad Personalization (ad_personalization): Consent for personalized advertising (formerly ad_personalization_signals).

Your choices determine how these services operate within the App:

•	If you grant consent: Google services will collect and process data as described for their respective purposes, including personalized advertising if consented to.

•	If you deny consent (or do not respond where no default consent is assumed): Google services will operate in a restricted mode. For example, Google Analytics may collect basic, aggregated data without using identifiers, and AdMob may serve non-personalized ads. Pings sent by Google services will be anonymized and will not use cookies or device identifiers for personalization.

You can typically change your consent preferences at any time from within the App's settings menu (e.g., under "Privacy Settings" or "Ad Settings"). We honour your choices, and these are passed to the relevant Google SDKs.

Cookies

Our Apps do not use “cookies” explicitly in the traditional web browser sense. However, third-party code and libraries integrated into our Apps (such as those from Google for ads and analytics) may use similar technologies like device identifiers or SDK-specific storage mechanisms that function like cookies to collect information and improve their services. Your consent choices, as managed through Google Consent Mode, will affect how these technologies are used.

Security

We value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting any information processed by our Apps and third-party services. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and We can guarantee its absolute security.

Links to Other Sites

Our Apps may contain links to other sites or services. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13 (or a higher age of digital consent if applicable in your region). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. In the case We discover that a child under the applicable age of consent has provided me with personal information without verifiable parental consent, We will take steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that We can take necessary actions.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and potentially through other means (e.g., an in-app notification or updating the "last updated" date). Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
